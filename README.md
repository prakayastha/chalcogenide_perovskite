# Chalcogenide perovskites

This is a project website for my chalcogenide perovskite project, that I am carrying out during the first year of my PhD. 

This project is a collaborative experimental + computational project which aims to carry out vibrational spectraoscopy on materials that are part of the systhesis of the BaZrS3 perovskite.
